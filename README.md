# race-pace-calc
What was originally planned was to do this in python. However as we started to do more in html and java, i found that it was going to be a lot easier doing it in 
that medium. My start goal of being able to pick a race and desired time, then calculate the pace i was able to achieve. With more time i wanted to kind of do the
reverse of that and take a pace and a race and convert it to a time. The other part was also adding in a text box for people to put in their own times. I still kind
of think this one would take a lot of time as it would need proper validation as well.
For anyone to contact me, at michaelajarvis@lewisu.edu
